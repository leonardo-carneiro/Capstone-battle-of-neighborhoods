We, then, use the geocoder library in Python to get the geographical coordinates from the districts, and store them in a pandas dataframe. \n\nIn order to explore and segment the districts according to nearby venues, we utilize the Foursquare API interface to extract the data and store it in a pandas dataframe. There are 296 different categories of venues and a total of 2,661 venues found on the Foursquare API. \n\nWith these data at our disposal we will be able to cluster the districts, determine similarities accross them and provide help in potential relocations job related."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
