    "Such a diverse culture translates to a diverse cuisine. We can find many different categories of restaurants in Sao Paulo: Italian, Asian, Argentinian, just to name a few. Sao Paulo attract many to start their businesses in the food industry, either small ones such as mobile food vendors, food truck and fast food joints, or larger ones as restaurants. Before starting to operate, though, they need to find the appropriate location to open. What do they take into account when making this decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon exploring the districts of Sao Paulo, I hope to find whether opening a restaurant in a neighborhood of restaurants plays a role in the success of the business. To simplify our analysis, this report focuses on the Italian cuisine based on the total number of restaurants we can find in Sao Paulo. The methodology used here applies to other cuisines as well."
